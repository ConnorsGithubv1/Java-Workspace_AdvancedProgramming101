The burden of college shouldn’t be put on my parents and I must take initiative on preparing for my future. This scholarship can help me pay to go Washington State University this fall semester. Unlike a lot of kids in my area I can’t push paying for college on my parents. I need to secure enough scholarships to bring down school costs and make my parents worry less. This scholarship can become my accomplishment, build on top of the other scholarships I am applying for, and pay for my education to become a software engineer.  ");
